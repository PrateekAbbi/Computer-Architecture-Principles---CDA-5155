__Computer Architecture Principles (CDA 5155) Projects Overview__

This repository showcases the comprehensive projects undertaken in the course of Computer Architecture Principles (CDA 5155) at the University of Florida, guided by Dr. Prabhat Mishra. More information about Dr. Mishra's expertise and contributions can be found on his LinkedIn profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/mishra-prabhat/).

The initial project focuses on the simulation of the RISC-V architecture, adhering to a sequential processing approach. This involves the methodical stages of fetching, decoding, and executing instructions in their original sequence, without the incorporation of parallel processing techniques.

Advancing from the foundational project, the second initiative delves into a pipelined rendition of the RISC-V architecture. This sophisticated model is segmented into five distinct stages: Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write Back. This pipelined structure enhances the processing efficiency and throughput, representing a significant evolution from the sequential methodology of the first project.
